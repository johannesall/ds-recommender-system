    "In this exercise, you will build a movie recommender system using the MovieLens dataset. The dataset contains more than 100,000 ratings of approximately 9,800 movies by 610 users. To get the data follow the following instructions:\n",
    "1. Download the dataset from the following link: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)\n",
    "2. Take the small dataset `ml-latest-small.zip`\n",
    "3. Extract the tables to a folder.\n",

    "The dataset contains the following tables:\n",
    "- `movies.csv`: Contains the movieId, title, and genres of each movie.\n",
    "- `ratings.csv`: Contains the userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp of each rating.\n",
    "- `tags.csv`: Contains the userId, movieId, tag, and timestamp of each tag. \n",
    "- `links.csv`: Contains the movieId, imdbId, and tmdbId of each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you need more information about the dataset, you can check the following link: [ml-latest-small-README.html](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html).\n",
