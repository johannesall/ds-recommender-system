    "## Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to estimate the user ratings is **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. **Singular value decomposition** is a matrix decomposition, where we decompose a given **m x n** matrix $A$ into three matrices **$U$**, $\\Sigma$ and $V$ with the dimensions **m x r**, **r x r** and **n x r** respectively. Here r is usually small compared to m and n. And $\\Sigma$ is non-zero only on the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/SVD_USigmaV.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "By decomposing the matrix $A$ in this way, we drastically reduce the number of elements to be stored. Let $m = n = 100$ and $r = 5$ then the original matrix $A$ has $100 \\times 100 = 10000$ elements. Whereas $U$ has $100 \\times 5 = 500$, $\\Sigma$ has $5$ (only diagonal elements) and $V$ again has $100 \\times 5 = 500$ elements leading to a total of only $1005$ elements as opposed to the $10000$ elements of the original matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows of m of our user-item-rating matrix $A$ refer to the users and the n columns to the items (fishes in our case). The introduced **latent factors** (r in above example) can be interpreted as characteristics of the users for $U$ and item characteristics for $V$. So the latent factors are features of items or users, generated by our **SVD algorithm**. In our case they can tell us how much a user likes a certain `visual_effect` or how much a fish shows said `visual_effect`. $\\Sigma$ then models the importance of each `visual_effect`.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned how to use collaborative filtering based on matrix factorization with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to make recommendations, by extracting latent features from the user-item interaction matrix. We used the Scikit-Surprise library to train an SVD model on a custom dataset of user ratings for fish items. We learnt then also how to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVD model using GridSearchCV. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we made recommendations for a new user who has not rated any items yet. We estimated the new user's latent feature vector using the SVD model and made recommendations for the top 10 items with the highest predicted ratings."
